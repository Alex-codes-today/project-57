            Soccer is one of my favirite sports. It is a great way to stay healthy, and I can play with my freinds. So its deffinently fun and amusing when you win! I play travel soccer for the town of cherry hill. Its alot of fun going to new places. Sometimes we even enter tourtimants, we can win a trophy or a medal. However it takes hard =work to win against other teams. So over all soccer is alot of fun!
